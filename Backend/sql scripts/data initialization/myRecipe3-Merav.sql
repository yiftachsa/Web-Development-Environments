Stuffed with potato, meat and caramelized onions. Very tasty! (from Mako)','Prepare the dough: Mix the flour, yeast and sugar. Add the water and put in the mixer. Add the oil and salt and put in the mixer for about 10 minutes-  until the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is beginning to pull away from the sides of the. The dough will still be slightly sticky but still should be manageable with your hands. Cover the dough and set aside for about an hour.  Prepare the potatoes: Bring water to a boil in a large pot and cook the potatoes until soft. Crush into mashed potatoes. In a frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the onion until browned. Add to the mashed potatoes along with the garlic, salt, the remaining tablespoon of the oil and turmeric and mix. Prepare the meat: Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the garlic in it for about a minute. Add the meat and fry until it changes color. Add Coriandrum sativum  and baharat, stir and turn off the heat.  Prepare the fried onion: Slice the onion into thick strips. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the onion until it is browned. Turn off the fire, add the Date honey and stir. Prepare the Chimichurri: Mix together the Coriandrum sativum  , garlic, mint, chili pepper and olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Preheat oven to 240 degrees. Roll the dough into a thin leaf and make large circles from it. On each circle, place a thin layer of mashed potato in the center, a little onion over, a little meat over and chimichurri over everything. Close both sides of the dough over the filling and the two corners formed are turned into a kind of knot.  Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes, until the dough is browned.', 4,'[{"amount":1000.0,"unit": "grams","name": "flour"},{"amount":3.0,"unit": "tbsp","name": "active dry yeast"},{"amount":5.0,"unit": "tbsp","name": "sugar"}, {"amount":2.0,"unit": "cups","name": "water"},{"amount":1.0,"unit": "tbsp","name": "salt"}, {"amount": 0.75,"unit": "cup","name": "oil"},{"amount": 3.0,"unit": "","name": "potatoes"}, {"amount":1.0,"unit": "","name": "chopped onion"},{"amount":3.0,"unit": "tbsp","name": "olive oil"},{"amount":1.0,"unit": "clove","name": "crushed garlic"},{"amount":0.5,"unit": "tsp","name": "turmeric"},{"amount":500,"unit": "grams","name": "Ground beef"},{"amount":2.0,"unit": "cloves","name": "chopped garlic"},{"amount":1.0,"unit": "cup","name": "chopped coriander"},{"amount":0.5,"unit": "tbsp","name": "Baharat"},{"amount":1.0,"unit": "","name": "onion"},{"amount":2.0,"unit": "tbsp","name": "olive oil"},{"amount":2.0,"unit": "tbsp","name": "date honey"},{"amount":1.0,"unit": "cup","name": "chopped coriander"},{"amount":3.0,"unit": "cloves","name": "crushed garlic"},{"amount":1.0,"unit": "","name": "Chopped chili pepper"},{"amount":4.0,"unit": "tbsp","name": "olive oil"}]','[
